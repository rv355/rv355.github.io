		<h3>Commuter Survey</h3>
		<p>
			We have conducted a large scale online survey involving more than
			300 participants across the globe, who mostly access the public
			transport system. Responses were obtained from different developed
			and developing countries including Italy, UK, Netherlands,
			Norway, Germany, France, USA, India, Nepal, Iran, Pakistan, Sri
			Lanka and Vietnam. Around 25% participants are female and are
			aged between 20 to 65 years. In our survey, we design the questionnaire
			to assess factors like total travel time, traffic congestion, sitting
			probability, road condition, bus type (AC or non-AC buses), number
			of stops, break journey, which reflect factors regulating commuter
			comfort and their interplay for a comfortable journey.

	<p>In a nutshell, this survey reveals that there exist multiple parameters
		(Figure 3), viz., speed of the bus, congestion, probability of
		getting a seat, etc, which impact commuters’ comfort during the
		trip, and individuals differ widely in their perception of comfort
		primarily depending on their age and gender. Moreover, the trend
		is quite similar all over the world</p>
	<p>
		ComfRide captures diverse
		features through smartphones, which impact the commuter’s
		comfort level while using public transport and develops a personalized
		route recommender employing the fuzzy set theory along with
		TOPSIS approach, which considers individual comfort level
		based on spatio-temporal road and route characteristics. Besides
		this diverse and wide suite of factors across various possible routes,
		single or multiple breakpoints in the journey is also considered, if
		that increases comfort.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics over a wide
		choice of features, we design the route recommendation algorithm
		using a specialized compositional model, called Dynamic Input/Output
		Automata (DIOA). The DIOA ensures that the system is not
		overwhelmed with the huge amount of data to be processed thus reducing
		the load on the system. Effectively, ComfRide utilizes DIOA
		based compositional model to identify the most preferable route
		efficiently based on the historical information and the context of
		the query. Moreover, the DIOA also provides a mechanism to dynamically
		modify the model to suit the personalized preference
		of a commuter on obtaining a feedback from her after a trip, thus
		improving the quality of recommendation after every trip.

		<h3>System Description</h3>

	<p>
		The overall system can be divided into two broad modules (Figure 5)
		– (a) the client module (the smartphone app) which runs the client
		automaton and (b) the server module (runs over a remote server)
		that runs the server automaton with various filters as internal
		signatures. Additionally, ComfRide uses a database to store the
		historical information that are used by the server module to apply
		various filters using the internal signatures.
